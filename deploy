This script is basically just a wrapper for stow. Although for vim and xmonad it does
some additional work that is needed for them to function properly.
For vim it initializes the git submodules so that all vim plugins are properly installed.
For xmonad it installs xmonad and xmonad-contrib through cabal.

Available arguments are:
    --deploy (Deploy only dotfiles for things I use, e.g. i3 willl not be deployed)
    --conclude (Conclude only dotfiles for things I use, e.g. i3 will not be concluded)
    --vim (For creating the necessary folders, installation of plugins, and symlinking)
    --xmonad (For creating the necessary folders, installation of packages, and symlinking)
    --startx (For creating my commonly used startx empty files)
