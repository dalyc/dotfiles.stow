# Requirements
* xclip
* dmenu

# Description
Clipsync consists of three files:
* dmenu.sh: Shows menu allowing you to copy a line in CMD
* sync.py: Copies the output of xclip in CMD
* CMD (text file specified in variable xsel)

You will probably want to change the variable xsel in both dmenu.sh
and sync.py, to specify the file where you would like to save/grab.
